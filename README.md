todo: 
- if very large changes, asks confirm
- ~~"remember" a device~~, and optinally only try to find it
- ~~.sinkignore (haha get it because gitignore sinkignore laughing so hard rn)~~
- ui (make it electron not pyqt you cheap shit)
- delta sync
- multiple peers not just 2 (meshing it)
- system tray shenanigans
