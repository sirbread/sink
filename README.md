# sink
todo: 
- websockets
- if very large changes, asks confirm (maybe a different device was paired)
- "remember" a device, and optinally only try to find it
- ~~.sinkignore (haha get it because gitignore sinkignore laughing so hard rn)~~
- conflict handling (vro i'm just making git atp)
- ui (make it electron not pyqt you cheap shit)
- auth layer, sync key??
- delta sync
- multiple peers not just 2 (meshing it)
- system tray shenanigans 
that's a lot of work 
am i gonna the greed effect (one last change... one last change... uhh one last change...)
